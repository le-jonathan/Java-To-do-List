# Project 2: JavaFX To-do list

## Overview
This project was created during the course CS 1331, Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in the Fall of 2022. Our main objective was to employ JavaFX for constructing a simple, but effective to-do list application. This application facilitates efficient task management, provides regular updates on task completion, and helps to monitor pending tasks.

## Features
- **Task Addition**: Users can conveniently input new tasks to the list by providing a task name, type, and the duration required to complete the task.
- **Task Completion**: Tasks can be selected and marked as completed by the user. The completed tasks get dequeued from the list.
- **Task Status Monitoring**: The application keeps track of the total number of tasks, as well as completed and pending tasks, providing constant feedback to the user.
- **Task Detailing**: Users can specify the type of task and allocate the required time duration from the given dropdown menu.
- **User-Friendly Alerts**: The application provides helpful error messages and alerts in cases where a task is not added properly or when no tasks remain in the list.

## Technologies Used
- Java SDK
- JavaFX SDK

This project has been a great avenue for implementing the knowledge and skills acquired from CS 1331 - Intro to Object Oriented Programming. It allowed me to explore the power and flexibility of JavaFX for creating interactive GUI applications. The task also helped in sharpening my skills in Java, and to appreciate the value of efficient task management.
